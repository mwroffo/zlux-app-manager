# zlux-app-manager
This is the primary repo for the browser code of the Zowe App Framework.
It includes framework utilities that exist below the UI level, as well as UI constructs such as two window managers: A Desktop for visualizing multiple apps at once, or the "Simple" window manager for displaying just one app.
